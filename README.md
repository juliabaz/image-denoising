Image Restoration using the Bilateral and Non-Local means Filters

## Abstract
In this project, we discuss the noise-reduction capabilities of the bilateral filter and the non-local means filter with respect to gaussian & salt and pepper noise. The bilateral filter for image denoising applications succeeds in smoothing images while preserving edges. It does so by leveraging a nonlinear combination of neighbouring image values. The non-local means filter restores images by removing unwanted frequencies while retaining image textures that would be blurred out by other denoising algorithms. The goal of this report is to perform image restoration using both the bilateral and the non-local means filter in order to collect experimental data. The result of their performance is then compared with those of median and mean filters for denoising grayscale and colored images.
